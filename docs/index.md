## Project Overview

This project aims to improve skin lesion classification performance by:

- Applying **Neural Style Transfer** to augment the training dataset with more visual diversity.
- Fine-tuning a **MobileNetV2** model for efficient classification.
- Evaluating model performance across original and style-augmented datasets.

All datasets are derived from the **HAM10000** dataset.
