## Workflow

### Download and Prepare Raw Data

- Download the **HAM10000** dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000)
- Unpack both ZIP files and place all images in:
  ```
  data/raw/HAM10000/images
  ```
- Place the metadata CSV file in:
  ```
  data/raw/HAM10000/
  ```

---

### Clean and Explore the Dataset

Run the notebook:

```
notebooks/01_data_exploration_and_cleaning.ipynb
```

- Explore the dataset and become aware of the gross class imbalance
- Remove duplicate images and ave a cleaned metadata CSV (`HAM10000_metadata_clean.csv`)

---

### Prepare Initial Datasets

Prepare datasets for training:

```bash
python prepare_dataset_stage_1.py \
  --input_dir data/raw/HAM10000/images \
  --metadata data/raw/HAM10000/HAM10000_metadata_clean.csv \
  --output_dir data/processed/ \
  --random_state 42
```

Creates:

- A **test dataset** that is held out completely, both during neural style transfer and during model fine-tuning
- An **unbalanced dataset** (with train/validation split) that becomes the training data for the stage 1 of fine-tuning
- A **balanced dataset** with all images from the smallest class and a random selection of the same number of images from the larger classes

---

### Generate Style-Transferred Images

Apply Neural Style Transfer to augment images:

```bash
python nst_batch.py \
  --content data/processed/dataset_balanced \
  --style data/processed/style-images-resized \
  --output data/processed/dataset_balanced_nst
```

Generates style-transferred versions of the balanced dataset. Uses the provided [style images](data/processed/style-images-resized/).

For detailed information about NST processing, see [NST README](scripts/nst/README.md).

---

### Explore NST Images

Run the notebook:

```
notebooks/02_examine_and_select_nst_images.ipynb
```

- Explore and examine generated NST images
- Run quantitative evaluations and remove images that do not meet requirements

---

### Prepare Stage 2 Dataset

Combine the original balanced and the NST dataset to create the stage 2 dataset for fine-tuning:

```bash
python prepare_dataset_stage_2.py \
  --original_dir data/processed/dataset_balanced \
  --st_dir data/processed/dataset_balanced_nst \
  --output_dir data/processed/dataset_stage2
```

---

### Model Training

Model training occurs in two stages:

#### Stage 1
In the first stage, a base model is fine-tuned on the unbalanced stage 1 dataset. The base model is a pre-trained MobileNetv2 with all but the last layer block frozen and a classification head on top. Macro F1 Score is used as validation metric.

```bash
python training_stage_1.py \
  --train_dir data/processed/dataset_stage1/train \
  --val_dir data/processed/dataset_stage1/val
```
#### Stage 2
In the second stage, the best model from stage 1 is further fine-tuned, now on the NST-augmented, balanced stage 2 dataset, using a cross-style approach.

```bash
python training_stage_2.py \
  --data_dir data/processed/dataset_stage2 \
  --base_model outputs/models/finetune_orig_best.h5
```

---

### Evaluate Model Performance

Run the notebook:

```
notebooks/03_eval_model_on_testset.ipynb
```

- Assess the stage 1 and stage 2 trainings by ploting the training history of each
- Evaluate both models by running inference on each using the test set and plotting  some metrics:
    - Confusion matrix
    - Class-wise and macro F1 scores
    - Class-wise and top-3 classification accuracies

## Web APP Demo

A live interactive demo of the final model is available:

ðŸ‘‰ [Try the Skin Lesion Classifier in your browser](https://precious-haupia-39d814.netlify.app/)

The model was converted to TensorFlowJS format and deployed as a static web app.  
This allows real-time skin lesion predictions directly in the browser without needing a server.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow / Keras
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, tqdm

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes

- GPU strongly recommended for NST image generation
- Random seeds are set for reproducibility
